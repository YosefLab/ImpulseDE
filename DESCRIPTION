Description: ImpulseDE is suited to capture single impulse-like patterns in
    high throughput time series datasets. By fitting a representative
    impulse model to each gene, it reports differentially expressed genes
    whether across time points in a single experiment or between two time
    courses from two experiments. To optimize the running time, the code
    makes use of clustering steps and multi-threading.
